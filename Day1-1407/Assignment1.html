    <h1>Question 1:</h1>
    <h2>Explore and explain the various methods in console function. Explain them.</h2>
    <h2>Answer:</h2>
    <p><pre>
    1. console.log() :
        log() is basically used for printing any type of data into the console, be it a string, number, boolean, any type. It can even print calculations' output as well. ex. console.log(5+4) will print 9 in the console.

    2. console.error() :
        error() is used to print an error message as well as an error mark logo and the message comes in red color by default. Its used for testing. ex. console.error('An error');

    3. console.warn() :
        warn() is similar to error(), but it prints the message in yellow color by default and it warning logo is different than error()'s. Ex. console.warn('A warning');

    4. console.clear() :
        clear() is used to clear the console screen.

    5. console.time() and console.timeEnd() :
        These are used to print the time taken in executing some portion of code. they are placed above and below that code to be tested. ex.
        console.time('test');
            ...codes
            ...functions
        console.timeEnd('test');

    6. console.table() :
        table() is used to generate a table in the console. It requires an array or such object to be passed which can be represented as table.

    7. console.count() :
        count() gives the count for how many times a function ran for example in a loop.
        
    8. console.group() and console.groupEnd() :
        similar to time() and timeEnd(), these are placed above and below the section of console functions which we want to group as a single section.
        ex. 
        console.group('simple'); 
        console.warn('warning!'); 
        console.error('error here'); 
        console.log('vivi vini vici'); 
        console.groupEnd('simple'); 
        
        console.log('new section');

    <h1>Question 2:</h1>
    <h2>Write the difference between var, let and const with code examples.</h2>
    <h2>Answer:</h2>
    <p>
    <pre>
    var :
    var is used to declare any variable. Its scope is always global and it can be re-declared and modified as well at any point of code.

    let :
    let is also used to declare variables but is better that var to be used. It is block scoped and it cant be re-declared within its scope but can be modified there.

    const :
    const is another keyword to declare variables. const has a constant property that means it cant be modified not it can be re-declared. Similar to let, const is also block scoped and can be accessed within its scope.

    <h1>Question 3:</h1>
    <h2>Write a brief intro on available data types in Javascript.</h2>
    <h2>Answer:</h2>
    <p>
    <pre>
        There are 8 basic data types in JavaScript:

        number : integer or floating-point, integers are limited by ±253.
        bigint : for integer numbers of arbitrary length.
        string : A string may have zero or more characters, there’s no separate single-character type.
        boolean : true/false.
        null : unknown values – a standalone type that has a single value null.
        undefined : unassigned values – a standalone type that has a single value undefined.
        object : more complex data structures.
        symbol : unique identifiers.
