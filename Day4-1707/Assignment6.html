    <h1>
        Write a loop which prompts for a number greater than 100. If the visitor enters another number – ask them to input again.</br>
        The loop must ask for a number until either the visitor enters a number greater than 100 or cancels the input/enters an empty line.</br>
        Here we can assume that the visitor only inputs numbers. There’s no need to implement a special handling for a non-numeric input in this task.
