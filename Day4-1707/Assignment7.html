    <h1>
        An integer number greater than 1 is called a ​prime​ if it cannot be divided without a remainder by anything except 1 and itself.</br>
        In other words, n > 1 is a prime if it can’t be evenly divided by anything except 1 and n.</br>
        For example, 5 is a prime, because it cannot be divided without a remainder by 2, 3 and 4.</br>
        Write the code which outputs prime numbers in the interval from 2 to n.</br>
        For n = 10 the result will be 2,3,5,7.</br>
        P.S. The code should work for any n, not be hard-tuned for any fixed value
